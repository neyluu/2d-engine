IDEAS
1. Resource manager to load textures -> goal is to avoid loading the same texture multiple times
2. Particles 
   - Some kind of generator
3. Animations
   - Loading gifs in SpriteAnimation


BUGS / POTENTIAL CHANGES
1. change type of Sprite filename argument to const string reference
2. size in Sprite doesn't have to be private with getters and setters, public var should be enough
